# Eta-people-register
Eta is a result of an assigned task which aims to experiment in managing text files using C language. The user can register numerous people in a `.txt` file, search and modify their information. They are also able to generate a matrix of similarities between each other.

## Assigned Task
```
You must develop a program to register people and calculate the degree of affinity between them.
For each person, register:
Name, Date of Birth, Email, Phone Number, plus the elements that will generate the degrees of affinity:
Football Team, Course Team, Sport, Profession, City, and add at least six more elements of your choice.

The program must contain a user menu with options to register users, search for users by the elements that make up the affinity table, and generate an affinity table between the registered individuals. This table must also be saved in a file. The registered data must be saved in a second file.

Present the program working with a minimum of 25 pre-registered individuals.
```
